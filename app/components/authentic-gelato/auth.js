                <p>At Elisa Gelato, we use the traditional way of preparing, storing and serving high quality gelato. 
                      Gelato is stored in pozzetti â€“ stainless steel cylindrical containers deep inside the counter and covered with lids.  
                      Using pozzetti ensures that our gelato remains at the right temperature, so as to maintain its soft, smooth and creamy texture.
                      We are not about marketing or international expansion.
